== Goals

//[NOTE]
//====
Goals are "needs of the target organization, which the system will address". 
While the development team is the principal user of the other books, the Goals book addresses a wider audience: essentially, all stakeholders (see {Handbook}).

It must contain enough information to provide a general sketch of the entire project. 
To this effect, chapter G.3 presents a short overview of the system and <<G1,G.1>> will typically include some key properties of the environment. 
As it addresses a wide readership, it should be clear and minimize the use of specialized technical terms. 
Together, <<G1,G.1>>, <<G2,G.2>> and <<G3,G.3>> describe the rationale for the project. 
It is important to state these justifications explicitly. 
Typically, they are well understood at the start of the project, but management and priorities can change  (see {Handbook}).
//====

[[G1]]
=== G.1 Context and overall objectives

NOTE: High-level view of the project: organizational context and reason for building a system (see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

Many libraries still use outdated systems that slow down daily tasks. This project defines the requirements for a simple, modern Library Management System (LMS) to improve how books and users are managed.
The goal is to build a clear, adaptable foundation for future development.

//---- Requirement
[[g1-exp1]]
`G.1.{counter:g1}`
The public library system is designed to simplify and organize the book lending process across different library branches, making it easier for both users and staff to manage borrowings efficiently.
//---- 

//---- Requirement
[[g1-exp2]]
`G.1.{counter:g1}`
The system should help users easily place holds, check out books, and manage their interactions with the library collection in a clear and user-friendly way.
//---- 

//---- Requirement
[[g1-exp3]]
`G.1.{counter:g1}`
The system ensures that books are made available to users while respecting fair borrowing rules, such as limits on reservations and returning books on time to avoid overdue situations.
//---- 

[[G2]]
=== G.2 Current situation

NOTE: Current state of processes to be addressed by the project and the resulting system (see {Handbook}).

[[g2-exp1]]
`G.2.{counter:g2}`
There is no centralized, modern system in place. The structure and features of the future Library Management System are still being defined.

[[G3]]
=== G.3 Expected benefits 

NOTE: New processes, or improvements to existing processes, made possible by the projectâ€™s results (see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

[[g3-exp1]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
Librarians can easily add new books to the system, including details like title, author, and number of copies. This helps new books become available to users more quickly.

[[g3-exp2]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
Users can manage their loans, reservations, and account online, without needing to ask a librarian for help. This saves time for everyone.


[[g3-exp3]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
Users get alerts when a reserved book becomes available, or when a due date is approaching. This avoids surprises and missed returns.

[[g3-exp4]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
The system keeps track of books that are returned late. It can warn users and apply small penalties if needed, based on the library’s rules.

[[g3-exp5]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
Library rules (like how long you can borrow a book or how many renewals are allowed) are applied automatically by the system, so everyone is treated equally.




=== G.4 Functionality overview

NOTE: Overview of the functions (behavior) of the system. Principal properties only (details are in the System book) (see {Handbook}).

[[g4-exp1]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Users can search for books by title, author, or genre. They can also use filters to find exactly what they’re looking for faster.

[[g4-exp2]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Each user has their own page where they can see their current loans, reservations, due dates, and past activity.

[[g4-exp3]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Users can reserve books, even if they are currently borrowed. The system manages a waiting list and alerts users when it’s their turn.

[[g4-exp4]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Users can renew their loans if no one else is waiting for the book.

[[g4-exp5]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Librarians can manage the catalog, add or remove books, monitor usage, and apply changes to rules or policies through a dedicated interface.

[[g4-exp6]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
The system sends reminders before a book is due. If the return is late, it can apply the appropriate rules automatically.

[[g4-exp7]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
The system knows where each copy of a book is (borrowed, reserved, or on the shelf).


=== G.5 High-level usage scenarios 

NOTE: Fundamental usage paths through the system (see {Handbook}).

[[g5-exp1]]
`G.5.{counter:g5}`
Encourage More Visitors

[[g5-exp2]]
`G.5.{counter:g5}`
Help Students Find What They Need

[[g5-exp3]]
`G.5.{counter:g5}`
Smooth Experience for Regular Users

[[g5-exp4]]
`G.5.{counter:g5}`
Better Book Circulation





=== G.6 Limitations and exclusions 

NOTE: Aspects that the system need not address (see {Handbook}).

[[g6-exp1]]
`G.6.{counter:g6}`
The system will not handle digital content such as e-books, remote file access, or integration with online academic libraries. It is also not meant to support payments, subscriptions, or any kind of financial transaction.

[[g6-exp2]]
`G.6.{counter:g6}`
Physical logistics like book shelving, RFID tracking, or managing multiple library branches are not part of this system. 

=== G.7 Stakeholders and requirements sources

NOTE: Groups of people who can affect the project or be affected by it, and other places to consider for information about the project and system (see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

[[g7-exp1]]
`G.7.{counter:g7}`
**Key Stakeholders**
The main people concerned by the system are:

    - **Library users**, who borrow and reserve books. Their needs include a simple interface, clear due dates, and notifications.
    - **Librarians**, who manage the catalog, loans, and user accounts. They need efficient tools to save time on daily tasks.
    - **Library Administrators** : They are responsible for setting the library rules and monitoring operations. Their needs guided the design of system configuration features and reporting functions.


[[g7-exp2]]
`G.7.{counter:g7}`
To define the system’s needs, we are relying on:

- Real-life usage of library systems we know or have observed.
- Feedback from students and staff who use university libraries.
- Documentation and templates from https://requirements.university to ensure alignment with PEGS methodology.

Non-functional: Must comply with best practices for password encryption and access control.


=== S.3 Interfaces

NOTE: How the system makes the functionality of S.2 available to the rest of the world, particularly user interfaces and program interfaces (APIs) (see {Handbook}).

=== S.3 Interfaces

[[s3-ui]]
`S.3.{counter:s3}`
**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

At this stage, all interactions with the system are performed through a web-based user interface. This interface is designed to be:

- Accessible via standard web browsers.
- Divided into sections based on user roles (user vs. librarian).
- Responsive and easy to use, even for non-technical users.

The interface provides access to all key functionalities described in S.2: catalog search, reservations, account management, and administration.

[[s3-api]]
`S.3.{counter:s3}`
**Future API Integration (Planned)**

Although no programmatic interface (API) is available in the current version, future development may include:

- A REST API for integration with external systems (e.g., university portals).
- Endpoints for retrieving book data, user status, or system statistics.

These additions would support automation, mobile applications, or third-party services.


=== S.4 Detailed usage scenarios

NOTE: Examples of interaction between the environment (or human users) and the system: use cases, user stories (see {Handbook}).

=== S.4 Detailed usage scenarios

[[s4-scenario1]]
`S.4.{counter:s4}`
**User Story: Reserving a Book**

As a student, I want to search for a book and reserve it online, so I can pick it up as soon as it becomes available.

→ The system shows the current status of the book.

→ If the book is borrowed, the system adds me to the reservation queue.

→ I receive an email notification when it’s my turn to pick up the book.

[[s4-scenario2]]
`S.4.{counter:s4}`
**User Story: Managing a Late Return**

As a librarian, I want the system to automatically detect late returns and apply the corresponding rules, so I don’t have to check each user manually.

→ The system flags the loan as overdue when the due date has passed.  

→ The user receives an automatic reminder and warning by email.  

→ If the book is still not returned, the system applies the penalty.

→ I can review and override the penalty if needed through the admin panel.


[[s4-scenario3]]
`S.4.{counter:s4}`
**User Story: Managing My Account**

As a regular user, I want to log in to my personal dashboard to check which books I’ve borrowed, when they are due, and if I can renew them.

→ I access my dashboard after logging in.

→ I see a list of current loans with due dates.

→ I click on a book to renew it, if allowed.

[[s4-scenario4]]
`S.4.{counter:s4}`
**User Story: Adding a New Book**

As a librarian, I want to add a new book to the catalog with all its details, so it can be borrowed by users.

→ I access the admin panel.

→ I fill in the book information (title, author, copies, status).

→ The book appears in the public catalog immediately.

[[s4-scenario5]]
`S.4.{counter:s4}`
**User Story: Checking Availability Before Visiting**

As a visitor, I want to check online if a book is available in the library, so I don’t waste time coming for nothing.

→ I search the book by title on the public site.

→ I see that it’s available and on which shelf.

→ I go to the library to borrow it.

=== P.6 Risk and mitigation analysis

NOTE: Potential obstacles to meeting the schedule of P.4, and measures for adapting the plan if they do arise (see {Handbook}).

=== P.6 Risk and Mitigation Analysis ⚠️

This section identifies potential risks that may affect the successful completion of the project, particularly with respect to the tasks and milestones in P.4, along with mitigation strategies.

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy

| **R1 – Technical Complexity**
| Integrating multiple technologies (Spring, React, PostgreSQL, Docker) may cause unexpected bugs or delays.
| Begin with a small proof of concept for each component. Plan extra buffer time in early sprints.

| **R2 – Lack of familiarity with tools**
| Team members may lack experience with some parts of the stack.
| Allocate time for guided onboarding, tutorials, and pair programming during the first two weeks.

| **R3 – Feature creep**
| New feature ideas might be added mid-project, risking delay or scope loss.
| Stick to a defined MVP. Any additional features are moved to a backlog for post-M10 consideration.

| **R4 – Insufficient test coverage**
| Lack of automated tests could lead to regressions and unstable releases.
| Define test tasks per milestone (P.4) and enforce CI checks on every commit.

| **R5 – Incomplete requirements**
| Some functional details might be misunderstood or missing at implementation time.
| Validate requirements early with librarian feedback. Update documentation iteratively.

| **R6 – Integration delays**
| Back-end and front-end teams might fall out of sync during API integration.
| Use API contracts (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) and mock servers to allow parallel development.

| **R7 – Team availability or dropout**
| Team members may become unavailable due to personal or academic reasons.
| Distribute knowledge and responsibilities. Maintain clear documentation to ease handovers.

| **R8 – Deployment issues**
| Errors may arise during deployment or Docker configuration.
| Test deployments regularly in staging environment using GitHub Actions.
