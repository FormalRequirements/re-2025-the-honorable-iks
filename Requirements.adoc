== Goals
Many libraries still use outdated systems that slow down daily tasks. This project defines the requirements for a simple, modern Library Management System (LMS) to improve how books and users are managed.
The goal is to build a clear, adaptable foundation for future development.
//[NOTE]
//====

//====

[[G1]]
=== G.1 Context and overall objectives

//NOTE: 

//WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

//---- Requirement
[[g1-exp1]]
`G.1.{counter:g1}`
The public library system is designed to simplify and organize the book lending process across different library branches, making it easier for both users and staff to manage borrowings efficiently.
//---- 

//---- Requirement
[[g1-exp2]]
`G.1.{counter:g1}`
The system should help users easily place holds, check out books, and manage their interactions with the library collection in a clear and user-friendly way.
//---- 

//---- Requirement
[[g1-exp3]]
`G.1.{counter:g1}`
The system ensures that books are made available to users while respecting fair borrowing rules, such as limits on reservations and returning books on time to avoid overdue situations.
//---- 

[[G2]]
=== G.2 Current situation

NOTE: Current state of processes to be addressed by the project and the resulting system (see {Handbook}).

[[g2-exp1]]
`G.2.{counter:g2}`
There is no centralized, modern system in place. The structure and features of the future Library Management System are still being defined.

[[G3]]
=== G.3 Expected benefits 

NOTE: New processes, or improvements to existing processes, made possible by the projectâ€™s results (see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

[[g3-exp1]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
Librarians can easily add new books to the system, including details like title, author, and number of copies. This helps new books become available to users more quickly.

[[g3-exp2]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
Users can manage their loans, reservations, and account online, without needing to ask a librarian for help. This saves time for everyone.


[[g3-exp3]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
Users get alerts when a reserved book becomes available, or when a due date is approaching. This avoids surprises and missed returns.

[[g3-exp4]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
The system keeps track of books that are returned late. It can warn users and apply small penalties if needed, based on the library’s rules.

[[g3-exp5]]
`G.3.{counter:g3}`
Library rules (like how long you can borrow a book or how many renewals are allowed) are applied automatically by the system, so everyone is treated equally.




=== G.4 Functionality overview

NOTE: Overview of the functions (behavior) of the system. Principal properties only (details are in the System book) (see {Handbook}).

[[g4-exp1]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Users can search for books by title, author, or genre. They can also use filters to find exactly what they’re looking for faster.

[[g4-exp2]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Each user has their own page where they can see their current loans, reservations, due dates, and past activity.

[[g4-exp3]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Users can reserve books, even if they are currently borrowed. The system manages a waiting list and alerts users when it’s their turn.

[[g4-exp4]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Users can renew their loans if no one else is waiting for the book.

[[g4-exp5]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
Librarians can manage the catalog, add or remove books, monitor usage, and apply changes to rules or policies through a dedicated interface.

[[g4-exp6]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
The system sends reminders before a book is due. If the return is late, it can apply the appropriate rules automatically.

[[g4-exp7]]
`G.4.{counter:g4}`
The system knows where each copy of a book is (borrowed, reserved, or on the shelf).


=== G.5 High-level usage scenarios 

NOTE: Fundamental usage paths through the system (see {Handbook}).

[[g5-exp1]]
`G.5.{counter:g5}`
Encourage More Visitors

[[g5-exp2]]
`G.5.{counter:g5}`
Help Students Find What They Need

[[g5-exp3]]
`G.5.{counter:g5}`
Smooth Experience for Regular Users

[[g5-exp4]]
`G.5.{counter:g5}`
Better Book Circulation





=== G.6 Limitations and exclusions 

NOTE: Aspects that the system need not address (see {Handbook}).

[[g6-exp1]]
`G.6.{counter:g6}`
The system will not handle digital content such as e-books, remote file access, or integration with online academic libraries. It is also not meant to support payments, subscriptions, or any kind of financial transaction.

[[g6-exp2]]
`G.6.{counter:g6}`
Physical logistics like book shelving, RFID tracking, or managing multiple library branches are not part of this system. 

=== G.7 Stakeholders and requirements sources

NOTE: Groups of people who can affect the project or be affected by it, and other places to consider for information about the project and system (see {Handbook}).

WARNING: This chapter should not be empty (following the _Minimum Requirements Outcome Principle_, p.27 of the {handbook}).

[[g7-exp1]]
`G.7.{counter:g7}`
**Key Stakeholders**
The main people concerned by the system are:

    - **Library users**, who borrow and reserve books. Their needs include a simple interface, clear due dates, and notifications.
    - **Librarians**, who manage the catalog, loans, and user accounts. They need efficient tools to save time on daily tasks.
    - **Library Administrators** : They are responsible for setting the library rules and monitoring operations. Their needs guided the design of system configuration features and reporting functions.


[[g7-exp2]]
`G.7.{counter:g7}`
To define the system’s needs, we are relying on:

- Real-life usage of library systems we know or have observed.
- Feedback from students and staff who use university libraries.
- Documentation and templates from https://requirements.university to ensure alignment with PEGS methodology.
